# RestfulAPI_Python_FastAPI
This project shows how to use a **Kafka Consumer** inside a Python Web API built using  **FastAPI**. This can be very useful for use cases where one is building a Web API that  needs to have some state, and that the state is updated by receiving a message from a  message broker (in this case Kafka).
